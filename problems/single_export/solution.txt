Here's the reference solution:

  

`module` is a special variable pre-defined for every file in node. It has a
property called `module.exports` that is used to set what a file should 
export when `require()` is used to load the file. browserify copies this 
functionality to make this way of exposing modules available to browser 
code.

In node, if `require()` is given a string that starts with a `./`, it will
look in the currently-executing file's directory for that file.
