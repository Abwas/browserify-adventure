Now that we have browserify up and running, let's use a module from npm!

First install the `uniq` module from npm by doing:

  npm install uniq

npm should have put uniq into `./node_modules/uniq`. browserify uses the
same module-lookup algorithm as node.js, so you can just `require('uniq')`
just like you would do in node.js!

`require('uniq')` returns a `uniq(xs)` function that removes duplicate
items from an array input `xs`.

For this level, use `prompt()` to fetch a string. Split the string that
`prompt()` returns by comma (',') and run the result through `uniq()` to
discard repeated items. `console.log()` the resulting uniq array.

Compile your program with `browserify` and pipe the bundle into
`$ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify` like this:

  browserify using_npm.js | $ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify
